# CG-NTOEARS: Consistent Gradient-Based Causal Discovery with NOTEARS

This repository implements a novel integration of **Consistent Gradient-based Learning (CGLearn)** with the **NOTEARS** score-based causal discovery framework. The aim is to improve the **robustness and generalizability** of causal structure learning under distribution shifts.

### üîç Overview

Traditional causal discovery methods like [NOTEARS](https://github.com/xunzheng/notears) optimize over structural equation models under acyclicity constraints, but often fail to generalize in the presence of spurious correlations across multiple environments or shifts in data distribution. In this work, we integrate the **gradient consistency regularization strategy** proposed in [CGLearn](https://github.com/hasanjawad001/CGLearn) to enhance NOTEARS with **invariance-based causal learning**.

We achieve this by:

- Computing **per-feature gradient stability** across environments,
- Selecting predictors whose gradients are stable (high consistency ratio),
- Enforcing structure learning only from these stable directions, improving recovery of true causal graphs.
